<h1>Health-Check</h1>
<br/>

<h2> Brief </h2>
<hr/>
 Health Check âœ” is a Machine Learning Web Application made using React that can predict mainly three diseases i.e. Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Cancer.
 This would be a Machine Learning Web Application that can predict three diseases i.e. Diabetes, Heart disease, and Cancer. The datasets have been taken from Kaggle. And overall analysis and model building for the diseases have been done in respective Jupyter Notebooks.
 
 
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <h2> Problem </h2>
 <hr/>
  The problem is to identify the disease on the basis of symptoms and other factors, and provide a user friendly interface that can be easily used by anyone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  <h2> Tech Stack </h2>
  <hr/>
  Tech stack like Reactjs, Python, Tensorflow, and other ML modules would be used for the following.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  <h2> Schedule </h2>
  
  The timeline of project would go as follows : 
  
  <ul>
    <li> Determining all tech required for solving the problem </li>
    <li> Creating a user friendly website for accessing the app. </li>
    <li> Define and Creating ML model for the problem/ </li>
    <li> Training and Testing the model. </li>
    <li> Testing the whole web app and finding bugs </li>
  </ul>
